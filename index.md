### Things I'm Learning in TryHackMe.

* * *

### EventLog Analysis:

*   Investigated Host-Centric Logs with Splunk SIEM: Analyzed Windows Event Logs (Event ID: 4688) to identify suspicious process executions, uncovering malicious activity on a compromised HR host.
*   Detected Malicious Activity: Tracked an imposter account, identified LOLBin usage (certutil.exe), and traced a payload download (benign.exe) to a Command and Control (C2) server.
*   Strengthened SOC Analyst Skills: Applied query-building techniques, utilized network segmentation, and investigated seemingly benign activities to detect hidden threats, concluding the SIEM module.

### Wazuh SIEM Investigation :

*  Configured and utilized Wazuh with Sysmon to monitor endpoint security, analyze logs, and investigate real-world cybersecurity threats like data exfiltration and credential-dumping.
*  Identified malicious files (e.g., SwiftSpend_Financial_Expenses.xlsm), decoded payloads using CyberChef, and reconstructed attacker behavior through command-line argument analysis.
*  Leveraged Wazuh's dashboard, search filters, and saved queries to correlate logs with attack vectors, enhancing incident detection and response proficiency. 

### WireShark Traffic Analysis:

* Explored Nmap scan detection, host identification through IP-to-MAC mapping, and spotting tunneling techniques like ICMP and DNS for malicious activity.
* Analyzed cleartext protocols (FTP, HTTP) for phishing or data exfiltration threats and practiced decrypting HTTPS traffic using key files.
* Gained practical experience in detecting network anomalies, identifying potential compromises, and investigating attacker behavior.
